                    <p>As team leader, I am responsible for general DevOps and product deployment management.
                        The natural overlap between leading a team and managing communication, morale, and scheduling
                        resulted in my taking over the position of scrum master as well. While the development of tech-based
                        products is new to my repertoire, I have a decade of experience in naval engineering, product line management, and scheduling of multiple platforms'
